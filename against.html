      <b>Refuse</b>: Yes , my dear friend to contradict your point I must say that.... Yes , it's important to refuse the waste that we don't need but it can do a lot of harm to our environment and indirectly to us coz , we refuse things but dump them in open places  which may be a serious cause of different kinds of pollution!!!! So , according to me I think that rather than refusing, <u>we should reduce</u> harmful and wasteful, non recyclable products.... and better to mention this would not have any adverse effects in the environment.

      <b>Reuse</b>: But how can it be my friend? You are suggesting to reuse products but i think it's not at all convenient! In a recent survey it has been recorded that due to the reuse of clay cups thrown away earlier a considerable number of people faced health hazards  like: A tea vendor reused clay cups and later the people who took tea in those cups suffered from food poisoning coz the cups were reused without proper treatment.

    <li>
      <b>Repurpose</b>: But I'm sorry I can't go by the point that you suggested. The things that we try to repurpose are often not long lasting. For example, if you repurpose glass ketchup bottle to store oil it will increase the chances of wastage of the oil coz the bottle is brittle. Repurposing rather increases the garbage materials.

    <br>
    <li>
      <b>Recycle</b>: My friend, yeah I got you your point but then recycling has many hidden costs in it which increases the expenditure, the recycled products are also not of good quality. Again separate sorting places and factories need to be set up for recycling which will no doubt increase the pollution mark in the environment. So the idea of recycling I feel will not help much....!!

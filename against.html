      <b>Refuse</b>: Yes , my dear friend to contradict your point I must say that.... Yes , it's important to refuse the waste that we don't need but it can do a lot of harm to our environment and indirectly to us coz , we refuse things but dump them in open places  which may be a serious cause of different kinds of pollution!!!! So , according to me I think that rather than refusing, <u>we should reduce</u> harmful and wasteful, non recyclable products.... and better to mention this would not have any adverse effects in the environment.

      <b>Reuse</b>: But how can it be my friend? You are suggesting to reuse products but i think it's not at all convenient! In a recent survey it has been recorded that due to the reuse of CLAY CUPS  thrown away earlier a considerable number of people faced health hazards  like: A TEA VENDOR REUSED CLAY CUPS AND LATER THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK TEA IN THOSE CUPS SUFFERED FROM FOOD POISONING COZ THE CUPS WERE REUSED WITHOUT PROPER TREATMENT.
